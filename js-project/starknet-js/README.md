## P0 - Interacting via Starknet.js 

Since JavaScript and TypeScript are still the leading languages for web development, and having witnesses the rise of Hardhat in Solidity, I think it is safe to assume that [StarkNet.js](https://www.starknetjs.com/guides/intro) is the best library to move forward with.

Of partcular interest here is realization that your account is a contract too !! 

To get started, simply - 

```
npm install 
npm run devnet 
node ./Path to a file 
```

Since the documentation on this is not quite sufficient, I recommend you go over this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqj0ENOE0EE) to understand how our JS interaction works. 

Moreover, I also recommend jumping into the Starknet-js channel in the official Starkware discord server.
