# Contract Factory

Contract Factory allow you to deploy contracts onto StarkNet. To deploy a Contract, additional information is needed that is not available on a Contract object itself.

## Creating an instance

`new starknet.ContractFactory( compiledContract , providerOrAccount, [ , abi ] )`

Creates a new instance of a ContractFactory for the contract described by the _compiledContract_.

`contractFactory.connect(providerOrAccount)` _for changing the provider or account_

`contractFactory.attach(address)` _for changing the address of the connected contract factory_

## Properties

contractFactory.**abi** => _Abi_;

The ABI the contractFactory was constructed with

contractFactory.**compiledContract** => _CompiledContract_;

The compiled contract the contractFactory was constructed with

contractFactory.**providerOrAccount** => _ProviderInterface | AccountInterface_;

Provider or account that are used to interact with the network

## Methods

contractFactory.**attach**( address ) ⇒ _Contract_

Return an instance of a Contract attached to address. This is the same as using the Contract constructor with address and this _compiledContract_ and _providerOrAccount_ passed in when creating the ContractFactory.

contractFactory.deploy( constructorCalldata, addressSalt ) ⇒ Promise< Contract >
Uses the provider to deploy the Contract with constructorCalldata passed into the constructor and returns a Contract which is attached to the address where this contract will be deployed.

The transaction hash can be found at contract.deployTransactionHash, and no interactions should be made until the transaction is resolved.
