# Zero Knowledge on Ramp 

Welcome to (hopefully) one of the most comprehensive one-stop-shops for Zero-Knowledge beginners. Having recently graduated college with a degree in Computer Science, I can relate with the people who think they don't know enough Math or Cryptography to get on the ZK track. But having gone down this rabbit hole for a month, I can promise you don't need to be an Alan Turing to understand the most of what's going on here. 

This tutorial is mostly meant for an undergrad-level builder-focused crowd that is looking for a quick and dirty way to get their feet wet and create a more scalable and privacy-preserving version of web3.  

## 1 - Get the basics down

I wrote a few google docs to help you understand the very basic premise of what we are trying to accomplish with Zero Knowledge Proofs. Based on what you feel comfortable with, I recommend giving both of these a pass - 

- [A Non Technical Primer](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11J8R8JhP2k0zlpoha4P9x4bDdkO_gVL8rcBJP9LH5pc/edit?usp=sharing)
- [The Basic Math Being Used](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18Kbhe58G5SF0mqoF9fdMf9dMeEvqRydi_IB5FpB0u9g/edit?usp=sharing)

## 2 - Write some code 

If you are a developer, and want an absolutely bare bones example of an implementation, check out the repository folders above. 

The first one is a solution set to Cairo Playground - an initiative by StarkWare to help on board developers to their ecosystem. The second one, though, is a DIY ERC-2o implementation with testing, JS integrations and lots of links to resources and cool new projects you can try out for yourself !!

## 3 - Check out some products

I believe the best way to learn something is by doing it. I highly recommend you read the following 2 case studies on existing ZK-based offerings in the web3 market. Both of them, [ZCash](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MPbQVGDpMXOK3u20M7VdNfT2mQnAwIZD6eMLkExYwY8/edit?usp=sharing) and [StarkNet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11UTUyofiaAcD_qItyrA0QxGdB-UE8nt9bAFThHETsP4/edit?usp=sharing), have carved a niche for themselves and proven to be robust solutions. 

Once you are done here, I urge you take a look at this mental model of the ZK Industry as it exists today. Finally, do read [this interesting paper](https://fisher.wharton.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Thesis_Terrence-Jo.pdf) by the Wharton School on ZKs for a more business oriented perspective. 

## 4 - Get involved in the community 

Finally, I think it's important to acknowledge that in such a fast growing space - you can never know enough. The best ways to stay in touch, IMHO ...
